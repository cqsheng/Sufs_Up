# An Analysis of Election Audit

## Overview of Project
    This project is used to determine the election winner by tallying the total votes across multiple different counties to determine the overall winner.
### Purpose
    The purpose is to determine which candidate won the election based on counting all the votes cast that are stored in a csv file. The votes are total together to determine who won the election and how many votes each candidate received. As well as which counties casted the most votes and what percentage of votes came from which county.

## Results
    Various election outcomes will be addressed here, and a picture from the text file with the results produced will accompany it. The results are located in election_analysis.txt in the analysis folder.
### How many votes were cast in this congressional election:
    A total of 369,711 votes were cast and tallied for this election.

## Summary
    The analysis was effective at providing the results for this election and can be modified to be used for any election.
### 1.Expanding the code to analyze multiple election audits:
    Currently the code can only analyze one file containing votes that must be pre entered into the code itself. The code can be changed to take user input on which files to run the analysis for and output the results for multiple files over and over again until prompted by the user to stop.
### 2.Take into account of political parties:
    To bulid onto the last proposed change, if the files also contained the political parties the candidates were assoicated with. The winning party for each county can also be determined, and in the case with multiple files the parties could be tracked from file to file to determine the overall winning party that won the most counties.
